              <p>
                Creating a wellbeing plan using Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa
                Whā model is a powerful way to ensure a balanced and holistic
                approach to health. This model breaks down wellbeing into four
                key dimensions, often visualized as the four walls of a house,
                each supporting and strengthening the others. Here's how I'm
                applying Te Whare Tapa Whā to my life:
              </p>

              <h3 class="heading-xsmall">Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h3>
              <p>
                Taha tinana is all about physical health—how our bodies grow,
                feel, and move, and how we take care of them. For me, this
                includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Regular walks.</strong> It's easy to get absorbed in a
                  coding session, but getting up regularly to take a walk helps
                  me check in with myself: am I hungry, drinking enough water,
                  or just need a bathroom break?
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Gym 2-3 times a week.</strong> This takes discipline
                  and setting boundaries, making sure I leave work at a good
                  time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Brushing teeth.</strong> Good oral hygiene is crucial
                  for preventing sickness.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Eating well.</strong> Home-cooked meals are a staple
                  for maintaining good nutrition.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Drinking water.</strong> Staying hydrated is
                  essential. My Frank Green bottle makes this easy and
                  attractive.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="heading-xsmall">
                Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)
              </h3>
              <p>
                Taha hinengaro encompasses our mind, heart, conscience,
                thoughts, and feelings. It's about how we feel and how we
                communicate and think. My plan includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Time away from the computer.</strong> Setting
                  boundaries and taking breaks to avoid burnout.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Quiet and relaxation time.</strong> Watching YouTube
                  videos, movies, reading, and just relaxing on the
                  couch—essential for an introvert like me to recharge.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Recognising burnout early.</strong> Taking extended
                  breaks early on can improve long-term productivity.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="heading-xsmall">Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h3>
              <p>
                Wairua can mean different things to different people—faith,
                religious beliefs, or a connection to the universe or something
                sacred. For me:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Quiet time.</strong> Spending time doing very little
                  and being aware of myself helps keep me grounded.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Walking commute along the waterfront.</strong> This
                  daily connection with nature is vital for my sense of peace
                  and spirituality.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="heading-xsmall">Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</h3>
              <p>
                Taha whānau focuses on our sense of belonging, who we care
                about, and who we share our lives with. My plan includes:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Monthly date night with Michelle, my wife.</strong>
                  Making a regular effort to stay connected as we are each
                  other's greatest support.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Walking to work with Michelle.</strong> This is a
                  great time to wind up, wind down, and debrief about the day.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lunchtime dates with Michelle.</strong> Semi-regular
                  lunch catch-ups to support each other, especially as she runs
                  her business by herself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Social time with classmates/workmates.</strong>
                  Building relationships beyond work goals to create stronger
                  connections.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >Hangout nights and board games with
                    neighbors/friends.</strong
                  >
                  Taking time for fun helps maintain connections and also
                  supports mental and emotional wellbeing.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                This holistic approach helps ensure that no part of my wellbeing
                is neglected. Each dimension supports the others, creating a
                robust structure for a balanced and healthy life.
