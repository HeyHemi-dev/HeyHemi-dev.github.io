              </h1>

              <h2 class="heading-small">
                What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and
                your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Learning about human skills has given me a fresh perspective on
                my ego—essentially, my self-view. A standout moment was playing
                a values vs. values game using ChatGPT. It illuminated how I
                prioritize values like innovation over tradition, courage over
                prudence, and integrity over loyalty. Surprisingly, I found I
                value community over independence. As an introvert, this
                revelation was unexpected, yet it highlighted my appreciation
                for what can be achieved through collective effort, pushing me
                to prioritize building connections and community despite my
                natural tendencies.
              </p>

              <h2 class="heading-small">
                What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
                learning and programming?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Our values subtly guide our decisions, influencing the software
                and businesses we build. Being aware of these values allows us
                to consciously embrace or moderate them, ensuring our work
                positively impacts others. Empathy, on the other hand, helps us
                connect with our team and end-users, fostering effective
                collaboration and creating user-centric software. Self-awareness
                enhances this process, making us better team players and more
                mindful developers.

                What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Interestingly, I didn't find the human skills learning
                particularly surprising. At 40, having navigated numerous life
                experiences, I felt familiar with many concepts. However, the
                clarity these lessons provided was invaluable. For instance,
                during a recent argument, the looping exercises we learned came
                in handy. They helped de-escalate the situation by ensuring
                clear communication—an often overlooked yet crucial skill.
                Despite my initial skepticism, these exercises proved to be
                practical tools for improving interactions.

              <h2 class="heading-small">
                What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
                learning?
              </h2>
              <p>
                The values section was particularly tough, primarily because I
                delved too deep. It's a vast topic, and while self-reflection is
                something I'm accustomed to, this exercise pushed me to explore
                even further. The depth of introspection required was both
                challenging and enlightening.
              </p>

              <h2 class="heading-small">
                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
                time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development
                Bootcamp course?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Focusing on human skills in a programming bootcamp is crucial
                for several reasons. First, collaboration is a core aspect of
                development. Whether working with fellow developers, designers,
                marketers, or open-source project committees, maintaining good
                working relationships is essential. Second, creating software
                that serves people effectively is central to good software
                development. Skills like communication, listening, and empathy
                are key to understanding and serving users, making human skills
                an integral part of the curriculum.

                Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
                like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
                practise programming instead?
              </h2>
              <p>
                No, the time spent on human skills is far from wasted. It's a
                crucial part of writing software that serves people effectively.
                However, I do have some reservations about the effectiveness of
                the exercises. Human skills are best learned through real-life
                challenges, conflicts, and compromises—situations that a
                controlled environment can't fully replicate. While I understand
                the importance of these lessons, I remain curious about their
                long-term impact. Nonetheless, I'm not an expert on teaching
                methodologies, so I'm open to seeing how these lessons will
                unfold in practice.
