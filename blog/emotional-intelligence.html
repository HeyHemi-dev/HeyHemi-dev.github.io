                Understanding Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
              </h1>
              <p>
                Emotional Intelligence (EQ)—a toolset for the heart and mind;
                It's all about recognising and assessing emotions, feelings, and
                thoughts. Think of it as problem-solving but for the less
                tangible issues of mind and emotion. You know how we talked
                about solving technical problems, reasoning, and working through
                knowledge? That's IQ. Now imagine the same thing, but for the
                less defined, more nebulous challenges—we're now in the realm of
                EQ.
              </p>
              <p>
                If IQ is like terminal code—defined, structured, with clear
                right and wrong answers—then EQ is like a chat with a LLM—it's
                fuzzy, probabilistic, flexible, and not always perfectly
                accurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why is EQ important, you might wonder? Well, it's because we're
                human, and being human is inherently fuzzy. Personal and
                interpersonal aspects permeate everything we are. Learning to
                navigate these aspects with skill is crucial, as it helps us
                better understand ourselves and our relationships.
