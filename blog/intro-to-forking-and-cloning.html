              <p>
                Today we dove into forking and cloning. Open source projects
                make it abundantly clear why forking is such a powerful tool.
                It's all about sharing and contributing while maintaining
                controlâ€”kind of like offering a piece of your knowledge to the
                community and letting them build upon it, but making sure it
                stays true to its original purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's not too different from how other communities share
                knowledge. A photography enthusiast might share an editing
                preset, and others can build on it, maybe even improve it, and
                share it back. However, Git and GitHub take this sharing to a
                whole new structured level with forking and branching, merging,
                and push/pulling. It's the same concept, but with more control
                and organization.
