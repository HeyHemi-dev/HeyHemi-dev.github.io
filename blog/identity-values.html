              <p>
                Today we dug deep into ethical decisions and the clash of values
                that often accompany them.
              </p>
              <p>
                An interesting example was my recent move into a new house in a
                townhouse development. With houses packed closer together,
                privacy becomes a luxury. So while the traditional Kiwi dream
                values independence, leaning into the community aspects of this
                new living arrangement opens up a wealth of positives. From
                semi-regular coffee catch-ups to home improvement tips (we are
                putting a ladder into our attic space) and shared meals,
                community living is proving to be a challenge worth embracing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Culture and people around us significantly shape our values and
                identity. Independence, for instance, is a value instilled in me
                from a young age. Being part of a big family with a strong, solo
                mother has left a deep impression of resilience and autonomy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speaking of strengths, a noticeable one for me is being a
                Futuristâ€”a constant forward-looking perspective keeps me eager
                to learn and absorb new information (a trait that's served me
                well in personal and career growth). But it's not all roses.
                Relationship building, for example, doesn't come naturally to
                me. It's an area that requires conscious effort to improve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working together isn't always smooth sailing, and my photography
                business with my wife is a testament to that. When tensions run
                high, one strategy that helps is changing the environment. It's
                like pushing a reset button for the brain, allowing us to
                revisit the problem from a fresh perspective.
              </p>
              <p>
                In conclusion, it's a continuous journey of self-discovery and
                improvement. We're constantly challenged to reassess our values,
                leverage our strengths, and work on our weaknesses.
