                Problem Solving and Overcoming Roadblocks
              </h1>

              <h3 class="heading-xsmall">Stuck on a Simple Problem</h3>
              <p>
                We often think that the path to mastering a skill is a straight
                line, but sometimes it’s more like a winding road with
                unexpected detours. One day, while tackling one of our
                Javascript Kata exercises (little challenges designed to hone
                our JS skills), I found myself caught on a simple problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                We had to check if a number was divisible by 3, 5, both, or
                neither, and return a specific word based on the result. It was
                straightforward enough for a single number, but the challenge
                was to extend this logic to an array of numbers. I started with
                confidence, writing a function to solve the problem for one
                number. But then, faced with an array of numbers, my brain hit a
                roadblock.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s when I turned to a technique that I’ve since learnt to
                love: writing out pseudocode. Sketching out the steps in plain
                language quickly cleared the fog, and I could see the solution
                taking shape. Piece by piece, I implemented the steps, feeling
                satisfaction as the function began to work perfectly for the
                array.
              </p>

              <h3 class="heading-xsmall">Solving Problems Elegantly</h3>
              <p>
                In another exercise, we were asked to add a list of students to
                a gradebook. The instructions made it sound like we should
                manually link each student to the gradebook, but I saw an
                opportunity to write a function. I wanted to practice using the
                <code>for…of</code> loop, which is so clean and readable. So, I
                dove in, writing the function from memory and using
                <code>console.log</code> to check my progress. It felt great
                seeing the code come together; I used ChatGPT to catch a few
                minor syntax errors and I was done. It was a moment of pure
                confidence and competence.

                Reflecting on Problem-Solving Techniques
              </h3>
              <p>
                Reflecting on these experiences, I realize how crucial various
                problem-solving techniques have become:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> This has quickly become one of my
                  favorite methods. It’s like laying down a roadmap before
                  embarking on a journey, making the actual coding part much
                  smoother. Plus, it doubles as great comments for future
                  reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Trying Something:</strong> Sometimes, just diving in
                  and trying to implement a solution, even if it’s not perfect
                  at first, is the best way to learn and improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong> Explaining my code to
                  ChatGPT, much like talking to a rubber duck, helps clarify my
                  thoughts and spot errors I might have missed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong> This has become less
                  daunting with practice. The more I encounter errors, the
                  better I get at understanding and resolving them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Console.logging:</strong> An indispensable tool for
                  pinpointing exactly where things go wrong. It’s like having a
                  window for my code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Googling:</strong> The classic go-to move. There’s a
                  wealth of knowledge out there, and knowing how to search for
                  it effectively is key.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Asking for Help:</strong> Whether from peers or
                  coaches, I’m pretty comfortable reaching out when I hit a
                  wall.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reflection:</strong> Constantly looking back at what
                  worked and what didn’t helps refine my approach and improve
                  over time.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="heading-xsmall">The Importance of Asking for Help</h3>
              <p>
                As for asking for help, I’ve never been reluctant. I know I
                don’t have all the answers, and I’m always ready to learn from
                others. The only time I hesitate is when I’m pushing myself to
                excel and don’t want to come across as too boastful (a nod to
                NZ’s tall poppy syndrome). But generally, I embrace the
                collaborative spirit of learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Problem-solving in coding isn’t just about writing the correct
                code—it’s about the journey, the techniques you develop, and the
                mindset you cultivate. Each challenge is a stepping stone, each
                roadblock a chance to learn, and every solution a reason to
                celebrate.
