                We are thinking about problem-solving in the context of
                programming. It's been interesting to reflect on my process for
                tackling challenges. For basic queries or when I need a bit of
                extra insight, I've found AI tools like chatgpt surprisingly
                useful. It's like having a rubber duck that talks back, someone
                to bounce off my thoughts, and get nudged in the right
                direction. That said, I'm still the type to be skeptical of just
                being handed an answer. I want to understand the how and why
                before I even get to the what.

                Sometimes, when I'm truly stuck, I've discovered that a change
                of scenery can work wondersâ€”going for a walk, talking it out
                with someone, or even switching up the medium I'm working with
                (like trading the computer for a journal or a sketchpad, or even
                cutting out squares of paper and moving them around physically).
                It sounds simple, but it's often these little things that help
                me see problems from a different angle.

                Looking online, there's a lot of discussion about how to think
                like a programmer, and a recurring theme is the importance of
                breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable parts. I've
                personally also valued building models or simpler versions of a
                problem to help wrap my head around it. It's almost like
                creating a mini playground where you can experiment and learn
                without the pressure of the bigger, more complex problem looming
                over you.

                I also learned about flipped learning, which seems to be the
                approach we're taking in this course. Instead of using
                face-to-face time for lectures, it's used for more interactive,
                hands-on learning, while the information dump is done
                independently. It's a bit of an adjustment for me, especially
                because I prefer to clarify things as I'm learning. But I can
                see how this approach can encourage more active engagement, and
                I'm excited to see how it will influence my learning journey.
