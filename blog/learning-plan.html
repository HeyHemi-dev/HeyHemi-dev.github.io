                What is your long-term goal or career pathway?
              </h2>
              <p>
                My long-term goal is to either found a tech business or work in
                the tech industry. I am passionate about building various
                innovative projects and am equally enthusiastic about
                contributing to someone else’s vision. The key aspect of my
                career is to remain engaged and passionate about what I create;
                simply filling a seat without caring about the work is not an
                option for me. I don't have a fixed destination in mind, but I
                definitely see myself making software that helps people (ideally
                non-tech consumers). Whether it's productivity software or
                helpful apps, I aim to make people's lives easier.

                What are your strengths and limitations when it comes to
                learning?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Several years ago, I took Gallup’s Strengthsfinder assessment
                and discovered that my strongest area is strategic thinking,
                followed by influencing and executing. My natural weakness lies
                in relationship building, though I recognize its value and
                strive to improve in this area. While empathy didn't rank highly
                in Strengthsfinder, I believe I have a significant capacity for
                caring about the end-user experience and eliminating small
                frustrations.

                What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
                Bootcamp will be?
              </h2>
              <p>
                My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will likely be
                taking control during pair-programming exercises and listening
                to my partner's ideas. Recognizing the value of another
                perspective is essential, and I will do my best to manage this
                dynamic.

                What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
                developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I aim to foster a greater sense of connectedness, appreciating
                others' perspectives and building upon them. The adage "a rising
                tide lifts all boats" resonates with me, emphasizing the
                importance of mutual support and growth. Better teamwork and
                communication are skills I am eager to develop.

                How will you manage your workload in this program?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I have already made plans with my partner to carve out dedicated
                time for this course. Setting boundaries and ensuring downtime
                for recharging are crucial. I will manage my workload by
                balancing productivity with self-care, and collaborating
                effectively with fellow learners, facilitators, and
                industry/community representatives. When things become
                overwhelming, I will reassess my priorities and seek support as
                needed.

              </h2>
              <p>
                While the Discord group is a valuable resource, I also look
                forward to having a supportive cohort at the Wellington office
                during the boot camp. We will be doing hybrid learning (part
                in-person, part remote). I aim to be present on Discord and in
                person to stay connected to the rest of my cohort.

                What do you expect from the Facilitation team?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I expect the Facilitation team to be physically present in the
                Wellington office as much as possible. Their in-person support
                will significantly enhance our study experience and provide the
                necessary guidance.
              </p>

                Do you have any other commitments or scheduling conflicts to
                manage?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I have one major commitment: photographing a wedding in
                mid-July. However, I do not anticipate this affecting the boot
                camp phase of the program. Additionally, I need to consider
                transit to and from Lower Hutt, but I am already working on
                maintaining consistent and early wake-up and travel times to the
                city.
