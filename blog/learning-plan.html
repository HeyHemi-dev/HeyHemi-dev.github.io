                What is your long-term goal or career pathway?
              </h2>
              <p>
                My long-term goal is to either found a tech business or work in
                the tech industry. I am passionate about building various
                innovative projects and am equally enthusiastic about
                contributing to someone else’s vision. The key aspect of my
                career is to remain engaged and passionate about what I create;
                simply filling a seat without caring about the work is not an
                option for me.

                A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
                learning
              </h2>
              <p>
                Several years ago, I took Gallup’s Strengthsfinder assessment
                and discovered that my strongest area is strategic thinking,
                followed by influencing and executing. My natural weakness lies
                in relationship building, though I recognize its value and
                strive to improve in this area.

                What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
                developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I aim to foster a greater sense of connectedness, appreciating
                others' perspectives and building upon them. The adage "a rising
                tide lifts all boats" resonates with me, emphasizing the
                importance of mutual support and growth.

                A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
                program
              </h2>
              <p>
                I have already made plans with my wife/partner to carve out
                dedicated time for this course. Setting boundaries and ensuring
                downtime for recharging are crucial. I will manage my workload
                by balancing productivity with self-care, collaborating
                effectively with fellow learners, facilitators, and
                industry/community representatives. When things become
                overwhelming, I will reassess my priorities and seek support as
                needed.

              <h2 class="heading-small">
                A commitment to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
              </h2>
              <p>
                While the Discord group is a valuable resource, I also look
                forward to having a supportive cohort at the Wellington office
                during the boot camp. Being physically present with peers should
                facilitate seeking help and support when needed.
              </p>

                A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
              </h2>
              <p>
                I expect the Facilitation team to be physically present in the
                Wellington office as much as possible. Their in-person support
                will significantly enhance our study experience and provide the
                necessary guidance.
              </p>

                committed to other things

              <p>
                I have one major commitment: photographing a wedding in
                mid-July. However, I do not anticipate this affecting the boot
                camp phase of the program. Additionally, I need to consider
                transit to and from Lower Hutt, but I am already working on
                maintaining consistent and early wake-up and travel times to the
                city.
